# Inboxbooster-Mailer
Cloud native Open Source MTA. 
A typical Intel 4 core Xeon Haswell server has a throughput of > 10 emails per second.

[Changelog](CHANGELOG.md)

## Use cases
### Transactional emails
The Mailer can easily be setup to send transactional emails.
They have a high interaction rate and only requires a proper setup to work.

### Marketing emails
Marketing emails require careful monitoring of interaction, and possible
blacklisting. 

We're [happy to help](https://inboxbooster.com/) if you need help with monitoring and deliverability.

### Cold outreach
Cold outreach emails require very careful monitoring of interaction.
The biggest effort should be spent on sending to a good high quality
list of leeds, where the leads have a reasonable chance of being interested.

We're [happy to help](https://inboxbooster.com/) if you need help with your cold outreach.
